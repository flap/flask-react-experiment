FLASK.JSONIFY vs JSON.DUMPS (with Flask)

Jsonify wraps json.dumps to add a few enhancements that make life easier. It turns the JSON output into a Response object with the application/json mimetype. Meanwhile the json.dumps only serialize the object to a JSON formatted string.

REQUIREMENTS.TXT vs PIPENV

Pipenv is the combination of third-party package dependency management, as npm and yarn, and virtual environment for project isolation. The requirenments.txt is the pipenv package dependency management percursor where the dependencies were set and managed manually.
